# App Router Structure

- Create routes under `src/app/(feature)/...` using Next.js App Router conventions.
- Keep feature-specific components under the feature folder; reuse shared UI from `src/components/ui/*`.
- Prefer server components unless client interactivity is required.
- Place shared contexts under `src/context/*`.
- Colocate a `types.ts` for feature-specific types and align with backend schemas.

- Example helpers: [helpers.ts](mdc:wy-frontend/src/app/retreats/helpers.ts)
- Shared UI library: `src/components/ui/*`
